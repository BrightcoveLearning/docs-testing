    <h2 id="What_is_Brightcove_Answers">What is Brightcove Answers?</h2>
    <p><strong>Brightcove Answers</strong> is not a human or bot. Instead, it is an artificial intelligence search tool designed to help your find answers to your questions. It works best when you ask it full questions, such as: "how do I add captions to a video?".</p>

    <h2 id="How_does_Brightcove_Answers_work">How does Brightcove Answers work?</h2>
    <p>You can find Brightcove Answers in all of our documentation pages and customer portal by clicking on the <strong>Have a question?</strong> or <strong>Ask a question</strong> button:</p>

      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Brightcove Answers Button</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When you click the button, a chat-like interface will display, and you can start asking your questions:</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Again, Brightcove Answers will be more helpful if you ask full questions rather than just using it as a search engine:</p>
